# FLIPM – Flexible Linear Inverted Pendulum Model

This repository contains the reference implementation and supplementary material for the **Flexible Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (FLIPM)**, as introduced in the paper:

> **Flexible Linear Inverted Pendulum Model for Cost-Effective Biped Robots**  
> Oliver Urbann, Ingmar Schwarz, Matthias Hofmann  
> *IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2015*

FLIPM extends the classical Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) by explicitly modeling joint and structural flexibility using an additional center of mass connected via a spring-damper system. This allows the generation of stable walking motions on lightweight and cost-effective humanoid robots, where compliance and servo dynamics play a significant role.
